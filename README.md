**This is a fork of the superb original Jamf Framework Redeploy app by [red5coder](https://github.com/red5coder), which you can find [here](https://github.com/red5coder/Jamf-Framework-Redeploy).**
This is a great app which any Mac admin should have, now with a CSV upload for a build redeployment.

With the release of Jamf Pro 10.36, a new API endpoint was added, which allows you to distribute a QuickAdd.pkg to the macOS client to re-deploy the Jamf Framework. Under the hood, its using the InstallEnterpriseApplication MDM command.

The Jamf Framework Redeploy utility provides both **single computer** and **bulk operations** modes to easily call this API and re-deploy the Jamf Framework for selected computers.

## üñ•Ô∏è Interface Modes

### Single Computer Mode
Perfect for deploying to individual machines with real-time feedback.

### Bulk Operations Mode
Efficiently process multiple computers using CSV import with progress tracking.

## üìã Requirements

- Jamf Pro API Role/Client with the following minimum permissions:
  - Send Computer Remote Command to Install Package
  - Read - Computers
- Jamf Pro Server Settings:
  - Read - Checkin

## üìÑ CSV File Format

For bulk operations import a .csv.
The CSV can be a simple list of serials no header is required or multiple columns.
See the example CSV files:
