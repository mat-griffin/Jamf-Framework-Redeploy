# Jamf-Framework-Redeploy
**This is a fork of the superb original Jamf Framework Redeploy app by [red5coder](https://github.com/red5coder), which you can find [here](https://github.com/red5coder/Jamf-Framework-Redeploy).**
This is a great app which any Mac admin should have, now with a CSV upload for a build redeployment.

With the release of Jamf Pro 10.36, a new API endpoint was added, which allows you to distribute a QuickAdd.pkg to the macOS client to re-deploy the Jamf Framework. Under the hood, its using the InstallEnterpriseApplication MDM command.

The Jamf Framework Redeploy utility provides both **single computer** and **bulk operations** modes to easily call this API and re-deploy the Jamf Framework for selected computers.

## üñ•Ô∏è Interface Modes

### Single Computer Mode
Perfect for deploying to individual machines with real-time feedback.
